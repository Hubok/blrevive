A patcher and easy GUI which enables Blacklight: Retribution for PC platform after the official servers were shutdown in 2019!



> This project is still under heavy development and fundamental things may change in future. Currently, we're looking to switch to the v1.40 client (latest pre-parity patch available) since we found resources for the old server environment. If things go well, we gonna use that one instead of the current v3.02!
